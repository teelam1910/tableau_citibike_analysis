## Introduction
This report presents an analysis of the Citi Bike ridership data, focusing on two main dashboards: the User Analytics Dashboard and the Station's Performance Analytics Dashboard. These dashboards provide insights into trip durations, popular stations, user demographics, and station-specific metrics. The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns to enhance urban mobility and improve the Citi Bike program.

## User Analytics Dashboard

### Overview
The User Analytics Dashboard explores trip durations, popular stations, and user demographics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the biking community.

### Key Findings
- **Dynamic Visualization Map**: The station at 12 Ave & W 40 St exhibited significant growth over the months, starting with fewer than 3,000 trips in January and reaching around 13,500 trips in June. This dramatic increase highlights the station's growing popularity and seasonal ridership trends.
- **Monthly Trends**: The line chart shows an impulsive 40% increase in the number of trips from February to March, indicating a notable rise in ridership during this period.
- **Trip Duration by Gender**: The average trip duration for females is 17.1 minutes, while males have a slightly shorter average trip duration of 14.2 minutes. This suggests that female riders tend to take longer trips compared to male riders.
- **Trip Duration by User Type**: Customers have an average trip duration of 39 minutes, whereas subscribers have a much shorter average trip duration of 13.4 minutes, indicating that customers tend to take longer trips compared to subscribers.
- **Peak Timings**: The peak timing for trips occurs at 5 PM, which has the highest number of trips each day, followed by 8 AM, indicating significant usage during typical commuting hours.

## Station's Performance Analytics Dashboard

### Overview
The Station's Performance Analytics Dashboard focuses on station-specific metrics, including the most popular start and end stations, common routes, and trip durations. It provides insights into the geographical distribution of stations and user demographics.

### Key Findings
- **Top 10 Most Popular Start Stations**: Pershing Square North is the most popular start station with approximately 71,000 trips, making it the station with the highest usage. This highlights its strategic importance in the Citi Bike network.
- **Top 10 Most Popular End Stations**: Pershing Square North also emerges as the busiest end station, with around 71,000 trips, likely due to its strategic location in Midtown Manhattan.
- **Least Used Stations**: NYCBS Depot Delancey has the fewest trips, with just 5 recorded, indicating its primary role as a maintenance or storage facility. Other bottom end stations, such as Newark Ave and JC Medical Center, reflect minimal usage, likely due to their specific destinations or limited commuter demand.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Citi Bike data reveals significant insights into ridership patterns and station performance. Key findings include the dramatic growth in trips at specific stations, notable differences in trip durations by gender and user type, and peak usage times aligning with commuting hours. These insights can help enhance urban mobility and inform strategic decisions to improve the Citi Bike program for all users.
